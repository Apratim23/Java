//object=an instance of a class that may contain attributes and methods
	//example:phone,desk,pens,coffee cups
//constructor is a special method when an object is substantiated	
//local=declared inside a method visible only to that method
//global=declared outside a method,but within a class visible to all parts of a class
//overloaded constructors multiple constructors within a class with the same name,
//	but have different parameters name+parameters=signature
	
// toString()=special method that all objects inherit that returns that textually represents an object can be used both implicitly and explicitly	
// static = modifier..A single copy of the variable/method is created and shared. The class owns the static method
// Inheritance is the process where only one class acquires the attributes and methods of another.
//Method overriding is declaring a method in subclass which is already present in parent class done so that a child class can give its own implementation.
//super keyword refers to superclass (parent) of an object very similar to "this" keyword	
//	Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can have a subclass abstract methods are declared without an implementation
